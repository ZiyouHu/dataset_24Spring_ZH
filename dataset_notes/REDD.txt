whole-home and circuit/device specific electricity consumption
several real houses
several months

For each house:
1) the whole home electricity signal at 15 kHz
2) <= 24 individual circuits in the home -- each labeled with its category of appliance or appliances at 0.5 Hz
3) <= 20 plug-level monitors in the home at 1 Hz -- focus on logging electronic devices where multiple devices are grouped to a single circuit.


Data colletion:

1) High frequency can be translated to lower frequency -> bulkier to store  (I should take a look at the units)

2) Real/Reactive power: what are they?

3) Use of external features?

4) Supervised / Unsupervised training

5) Training and testing generalization

6) Accomodatition for various evaluation metrics


A lot of disaggregation work has been focusing on detecting on/off??
