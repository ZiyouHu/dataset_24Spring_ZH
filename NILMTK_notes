NILM: break down a household's aggregate electricity consumption into individual applieances.

NILMTK: open source toolkit designed specifically to enable easy access to and comparative analysis of energy disaggregation algorithms across diverse data sets.

Contributions:

1. NILMTK-DF (data format): the standard enegry disaggregation data structure use by the toolkit.

2. Parsers from 6 existing datasets into NILMTK-DF format. REDD, SMART*, AMPds, UK-DALE, iAWE, PecanStreet
Q: How about datasets that don't belong to those formats?

3. Statistical and diagonistic functions which provide a detailed understanding of each data set.
- Detect gaps
- Dropout rate
- Dropout rate (ignoring gaps)
- Up-time
- Diagnose: checks all of the issues

4. Processing functions for mitigating common challenges with NILM data sets,

Preprocessing of datasets:
a) Downsample: to a specified frequency using aggregation functions

b) Voltage normalization

c) Identify the top-k energy consuming appliances

d) Interpolating small periods of missing data when appliance sensors did not report readings

e) Filtering out implausible values

f) Filtering out appliance data when mains data is missing

5. Implementations of 2 benchmark disaggregation algorithms. 2019: 3 benchmark algorithms
- CO (combinatorial optimisation)
	- Finds the optimal combination of appliance states, which minimizes the differences between the sum of the predicted appliance power and the observed aggregate power, subject to a 	set of appliance models.

- FHMM (Factorialn Hidden Markov Model)

6. Present a suite of accuracy metrics
- Error in total energy assigned
- Fraction of total energy assigned correctly
- Normalized error in assigned power
- RMS error in assigned error
- Confusion matrix
- True positives, False positives, False negatives, True negatives
- True/False positive rate
- Precision, Recall
- F-score
- Hamming loss
