NILM: break down a household's aggregate electricity consumption into individual applieances.

NILMTK: open source toolkit designed specifically to enable easy access to and comparative analysis of energy disaggregation algorithms across diverse data sets.

Contributions:

1. NILMTK-DF (data format): the standard enegry disaggregation data structure use by the toolkit.

2. Parsers from 6 existing datasets into NILMTK-DF format.
Q: How about datasets that don't belong to those formats?

3. Statistical and diagonistic functions which provide a detailed understanding of each data set.

4. Processing functions for mitigating common challenges with NILM data sets,

5. Implementations of 2 benchmark disaggregation algorithms
- CO (combinatorial optimisation)
- HMM (hidden Markov model)
