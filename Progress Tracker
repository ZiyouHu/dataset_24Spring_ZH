COVID has been taken into consideration for the past few years of energy dataset.
I see regional diversities: Asia, Europe, South America, North America. Yet to see Africa and Oceania.

Obtained datasets from UK Data Service. Had to register an account to access. Not so publicly available.
At least in Spain, smart meter became more available in 2018. Evidences of how COVID has influenced the energy usuage. Can pre-covid data be anaylyzed together with the COVID era data? Regional? 
Pay attention to data cleaning?
What is SIMEL and CUPS?

Data comes from India, China, Spain... (non-English-speaking countries) often claim that they are the first such dataset in the region.
I-BLEND: levels of infrastructure plays an important role in data collecting.
Reasons for abundace of energy datasets from EU: For this purpose, and to comply with EU energy market legislation, Member States have deployed smart metering solutions at the residential level1 that precisely monitor household consumption.

The installation of smart meters have become more common around the 2020. This might explain the (relative) abundance of data in recent years.

Does normalization make a difference? If so, what consequences are created? Are they resolved?

Is NILMTK only capable of working with 12 data sets?
Are we only exploiting the data converter functionalities of NILMTK toolkit? (I assume we are not using the algorithm comparison feature of the toolkit)
